I have been an enthusiastic programmer for over {{< years-since 2011 >}} years.
During most of that time I've worked on games and tools for game developers, 
but I'm always happy to explore new areas.

My other projects included web development, like this website, procedural art, AI, microcontrollers, 
but also 3d modelling, texturing, video editing, music composition, and almost all parts of game development.

I will also use any opportunity to talk about the Rust programming language.
