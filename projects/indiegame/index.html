This includes custom scripting languages, code generators, and lots of editor UI.</p><h1 id=features-and-tools>Features and tools</h1><p>The game isn&rsquo;t public yet, but I can write about some of the more exciting tools I have implemented.</p><h2 id=ability-scripting-language>Ability scripting language</h2><p>A specialized scripting language using a bytecode interpreter.
I have implemented a rudimentary optimizer, with a pinhole optimizer and reachability analysis.
It is fully sandboxed and will make it possible to create mods that can be safely downloaded from the server.</p><p>The language powers all abilities in the game, like turrets, teleportation, explosions, etc.
It is integrated tightly in Unity, so it&rsquo;s easy to create variations and change parameters.</p><p>The ability VM is also used in Unity itself.
C# code sends ability data to the Rust module, which sends back a list of values for visual effects.</p><h2 id=c-code-generator>C# code generator</h2><p>The game uses binary messages to communicate between server and clients.
Using Rust and C# this quickly became error-prone and hard to keep in sync.
In the end I decided to create a procedural macro in Rust to generate matching C#.</p><p>The generator creates C# classes to match select Rust structs and enums.
Optionally it can create ToString, Equals, and DeepCopy methods, constructors, or a match function that&rsquo;s similar to Rust.
It&rsquo;s also possible to add C# attributes to improve Unity editor UI.</p><p>At the time of writing, the project has over 30000 lines of generated code.</p><h2 id=dialogue-language>Dialogue language</h2><p>A simple dialogue language, with conditions, choices, and full localization support.</p><h2 id=data-driven-ai>Data-driven AI</h2><p>Inspired by the GDC talk <a href=https://www.gdcvault.com/play/1021848/Building-a-Better-Centaur-AI>Building a Better Centaur: AI at Massive Scale</a>,
I have implemented a fully data-driven AI system. It is easy to extend and can be customized for individual actors.
AIs can dynamically change to accommodate abilities.</p><h2 id=physics-customizations>Physics customizations</h2><p>To simplify my workflow and to optimize the server, I had to do a small dive into mathematics.
I added custom colliders to avoid expensive mesh colliders and manually derived formulas to calculated exact forces.</p><h2 id=steam-sockets-ffi-implementation>Steam sockets FFI implementation</h2><p>I also contributed the initial implementation of the Steam networking sockets api in <a href=https://github.com/Noxime/steamworks-rs>steamworks-rs</a>.</p></article></section><div class=copyright><a href=https://github.com/Nonakesh/nonakesh target=_blank>&copy; Simon Stix 2022</a></div></main></body></html>
